perspectives really impressed me, mashallah!

I also noticed some areas where we can work together to build even more confidence - 
but don't worry, every Arabic speaker I work with has similar patterns, and we'll 
make great progress together!

Here's what I'm thinking for your personalized English journey:
âœ¨ Focus on building conversational confidence
âœ¨ Practice cultural bridge conversations  
âœ¨ Strengthen grammar in natural contexts

The best part? All of this will happen through natural conversations like we just had.
